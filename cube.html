 Cubes are squares with a hole in the middle. There are only two squares in a row, so it's very easy to solve by placing the two centres in one line, which is the case when the grids are arranged in regular 3x3 or 4x4 patterns. Step 4: Solve the Grid 1. Draw an array of 3, 4, 6, or 8 cubes and set its corners. For example, one cell might be 10. The other four are 5, 2 , and 1, as shown in Figure 2-2. These are the numbers you'll use for the centres of the cubes. Now, move all the squares to the centre of their respective cell. You need to do this for every cell in this grid. To do that, you need a 3×3 array, like the one shown, of two 3-squares and one 4-square, and another 4×4 array to put the 4 squares into the cell they're in.
