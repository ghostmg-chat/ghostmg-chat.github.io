   With this project, you will prepare a storyboard (15 points) and create web pages for a minimum 3 page web site (45 points). Your storyboard will be submitted on paper. There is no deduction for design changes that you decide to implement after you have submitted your storyboard. Instead, in preparation for the gallery walk, you will be asked to complete a reflection entry in your notebook discussing the storyboard you started with, and how it evolved into the final website site that you actually prepared. Please check your time and complete the reflection to the best of your ability. The first 5 points will receive a free book of the 5-minute reflection. All 15 points must be completed in 5 minutes or less. To create a 5 minute reflection, complete these steps:
<br>1. Choose the page (top or bottom) that your reflection will go on
<br>2. Copy and paste the text in the blank on the right
<br>3. Write a brief description of what you are going to write on that page and on your entire page 
<br>4. Add the link to that article on all pages 
<br>5. Finish the entire 5 point project by copying and pasting the last point of each page. If you do not have time to do this in an hour, submit your work within the next 5 business days.
